# Jweeter

## React x Firebase

- This is a clone coding of Twitter for test/practice Firebase's real time database.
- This project is realized basically by Firebase, React(with CRA, Hooks, styled-components).
- I will convert this JS project to TypeScript after I've mastered more or less TypeScript.

## Routes

- [x] Auth.js : Route for authentication of user
- [x] Home.js : Main page - Functionalities CRUD of "Jweet"
- [x] Profile.js : Read/Update user information & LogOut

## Authentication

- [x] Email
- [x] Google
- [x] Github

## Add Styled-Components && Global Styles

- I prefere use Styled-Component because memorizing each class name would be hard when a project become big.
- So, I can put global style with Global Styles and put detail style in each route & component.
